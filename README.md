# rish

A small rogue-like game developed with SFML and C++

## Roadmap

- slice 1

  - hero can move around a map using arrow keys
  - enemy kills hero on contact
  - hero can kill enemy by pressing attack when adjacent to the enemy

- slice 2
  - scale window to something reasonable
  - enemy should wander the map autonomously following a predetermined path moving once per second
  - hero should have a health bar and take 1/4 bar damage from enemy on contact
  - hero should be killed when health reaches zero
